      "[{'id': 'wiki_1', 'text': 'April is the fourth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, and comes between March and May. It is one of four months to have 30 days.\\n\\nApril always begins on the same day of week as July, and additionally, January in leap years. April always ends on the same day of the week as December.\\n\\nApril\\'s flowers are the Sweet Pea and Daisy. Its birthstone is the diamond. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.\\n\\nThe Month \\n\\nApril comes between March and May, making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as June, September and November are later in the year.\\n\\nApril begins on the same day of the week as July every year and on the same day of the week as January in leap years. April ends on the same day of the week as December every year, as each other\\'s last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.\\n\\nIn common years, April starts on the same day of the week as October of the previous year, and in leap years, May of the previous year. In common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as July of the previous year, and in leap years, February and October of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, April starts on the same day of the week as January of the previous year, and in leap years and years immediately after that, April finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.\\n\\nIn years immediately before common years, April starts on the same day of the week as September and December of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, June of the following year. In years immediately before common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, March and June of the following year.\\n\\nApril is a spring month in the Northern Hemisphere and an autumn/fall month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of October in the other.\\n\\nIt is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the Latin word \"aperire\", meaning \"to open\", referring to flowers opening in spring. Another theory is that the name could come from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. It was originally the second month in the old Roman Calendar, before the start of the new year was put to January 1.\\n\\nQuite a few festivals are held in this month. In many Southeast Asian cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including Songkran). In Western Christianity, Easter can be celebrated on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25. In Orthodox Christianity, it can fall between April 4 and May 8. At the end of the month, Central and Northern European cultures celebrate Walpurgis Night on April 30, marking the transition from winter into summer.\\n\\nApril in poetry \\nPoets use April to mean the end of winter.

December 31 is followed by January 1 of the following year.\\n\\nDecember begins on the same day of the week as September every year, as each other\\'s first days are exactly 13 weeks (91 days) apart.

This means that this date would have the least daylight of any day in the Northern Hemisphere, and the most in the Southern Hemisphere.

It marks the birth of Jesus Christ. Epiphany, January 6, is also important in relation to Christmas. Advent starts on the Sunday on, or closest to, November 30, and some countries have their own related celebration before the 25th. Sinterklaas is celebrated on December 5 in the Netherlands and Belgium, and St. Nicholas Day on December 6 is also celebrated in some countries. The Scandinavian countries, mainly Sweden, celebrate St. Lucia Day on December 13, while Iceland celebrates Thorlaksmessa on December 23.
